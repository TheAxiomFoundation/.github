# The Axiom Foundation

**The world's rules, encoded.**

Axiom builds open, machine-readable encodings of statutes, regulations, and
policy rules. The durable surface is RuleSpec YAML plus normalized law data; the
tooling is designed for transparent review, deterministic tests, and compiler
validation.

## Core Projects

## Shared CI

Jurisdiction rule repositories should keep a small local `validate` workflow that
calls the centralized reusable workflow in this repository:

```yaml
jobs:
  validate:
    uses: TheAxiomFoundation/.github/.github/workflows/validate-rulespec.yml@<workflow-commit-sha>
    with:
      axiom-encode-ref: <40-character-commit-sha>
      axiom-rules-engine-ref: <40-character-commit-sha>
      axiom-corpus-ref: <40-character-commit-sha>
      rulespec-us-ref: <40-character-commit-sha>
      corpus-release-base-url: <https-r2-bucket-base-url>
```

By default, the workflow validates RuleSpec YAML under `statutes/`,
`regulations/`, and `policies/`.

Pin the reusable workflow itself by commit SHA. The workflow accepts no mutable
dependency refs: each dependency input must be a full commit SHA, and the
checked-out commit must be an ancestor of that repository's remotely advertised
default branch. Format-only ref validation is not sufficient.

Rules repositories should pin their Axiom toolchain in `.axiom/toolchain.toml`:

```toml
[toolchain]
axiom_corpus_release = "us-rulespec-2026-07-10"
axiom_corpus_release_content_sha256 = "<64-character-lowercase-sha256>"
validation_waiver_set_sha256 = "<sha256-of-exact-known-validation-gaps.yaml-bytes>"
```

This table is mandatory and must contain exactly those three keys. The workflow
does not accept dependency refs, versions, selector aliases, or nested ref
tables in it. Before running the encoder, the workflow downloads the exact
signed object from
`<corpus-release-base-url>/releases/<name>/<content_sha256>.json` into the
corpus checkout's matching `releases/<name>/<content_sha256>.json` path. It
checks the content address and release name immediately; the protected
verification supervisor then verifies its Ed25519 signature and supplies all
three public trust roots without exposing signing capability.

Configure those protected roots as `AXIOM_ENCODE_APPLY_SIGNING_PUBLIC_KEY`,
`AXIOM_ENCODE_EVAL_SIGNING_PUBLIC_KEY`, and
`AXIOM_CORPUS_RELEASE_PUBLIC_KEY` organization or repository variables. They
are deliberately not workflow-call inputs, so a caller change cannot replace
its own verification roots.

`known-validation-gaps.yaml` is mandatory and its exact bytes must hash to
`validation_waiver_set_sha256`. On a pull request, the encoder's typed waiver
audit compares it with the protected base revision and rejects any new or
broadened waiver; entries may only be removed. A toolchain or caller-workflow
change runs full RuleSpec validation so a release or waiver-set change cannot
hide behind changed-file selection.

The workflow rejects singular rule roots, separate parameter or test fixture
files, YAML fixtures under `tests/`, non-RuleSpec YAML outside the approved
roots, obsolete generated formula artifacts, manual RuleSpec YAML edits without
an Ed25519-signed `axiom-encode --apply` manifest, and unclassified PolicyEngine
oracle coverage. New executable outputs must either have
an exact PolicyEngine mapping or a harness-side `not_comparable` classification
with a rationale.

The generated-file guard is mandatory in this workflow revision. The retained
`run-generated-guard` compatibility input must be true. A consumer present only
in the PR head cannot opt into notary admission. A valid activated consumer on
the protected base selects the encoder's `notary-guard`; an absent consumer
selects mandatory `guard-generated`, while malformed consumers or unsupported
encoder versions fail. This revision therefore requires an encoder containing
`notary-guard` (the implementation is proposed in axiom-encode#1662).

For activated lanes, authenticated exact-byte producer lineage, current enrolled
writer eligibility and full chain verification replace legacy apply manifests.
The independently required, source-App-bound notary admission check must also
pass before merge. The workflow never enrolls a producer, signs an old draft,
or grants admission based only on author/version. Adopt this workflow only in
a dedicated reviewed lane rollout after v33 custody and NZ pilot prerequisites.

Set `guard-programs-root: true` on the caller to require manifests on the
composed-pilot `programs/` root too (default `false`). Enable it per repo only
after every existing `programs/` file has a manifest or manual attestation,
otherwise the guard fails on the backlog.

Repos can opt into stricter structure checks by adding
`.axiom/repository-structure.yaml`. When present, the reusable workflow treats it
as the source of truth for allowed top-level directories, allowed top-level
files, and per-folder file extensions or sentinel filenames. This is intended
for country repos that need to keep executable oracle adapters, generated
outputs, and source dumps out of the RuleSpec corpus:

```yaml
version: 1
allowed_root_directories:
  - .axiom
  - .github
  - data
  - nz
  - tests
allowed_root_files:
  - .gitignore
  - CLAUDE.md
  - README.md
  - known-validation-gaps.yaml
  - variables.toml
path_rules:
  - patterns: [".axiom/**"]
    allow_extensions: [".toml", ".yaml"]
  - patterns: [".github/**"]
    allow_extensions: [".yml", ".yaml"]
  - patterns: ["data/**"]
    allow_extensions: [".json", ".jsonl", ".yaml", ".yml"]
  - patterns: ["nz/**"]
    allow_extensions: [".yaml"]
    allow_filenames: [".gitkeep"]
  - patterns: ["tests/**"]
    allow_extensions: [".py"]
```
